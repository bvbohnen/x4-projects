'''
Main entry function for the overall python based server.
This will load in individual pipe sub-servers and run their threads.

Initial version just runs a test server.
'''
'''
Note on security:
    Loading arbitrary python code can be unsafe.  As a light protection,
    the pipe server will only load modules that are part of extensions
    that have been given explicit permission to run python.

    Permissions will be held in a json file, holding the extension id
    (from content.xml) and its permission state (generally true).
    A special exception will be made for the modding api's id, so it can
    load without permission set up.
    The permission file will be generated if it doesn't already exist,
    but otherwise is left untouched to avoid overwriting user settings.

    The general idea is that, if some random extension added a python
    plugin to be loaded which may be unsafe, by default it will be rejected
    until the user of that extension gives it explicit permission.

TODO: change permissions to be folder name based instead of id based.

TODO: maybe permissions from json to ini format.

TODO: maybe use multiprocessing instead of threading.

TODO: think of a safe, scalable way to handle restarting threads,
particularly subthreads that a user server thread may have started,
which might get orphaned when that thread function exceptions out
on pipe closure.  (Currently pipe servers are responsible for
restarting their own subthreads.)

TODO: rethink server restart behavior; perhaps they should not auto-restart,
but instead be fully killed when the x4 pipe closes, and then only
restarted when x4 MD api requests the restart. In this way, mods can change
their python side code on the fly, reload their save, and the new code
would get loaded.
(The md api would need to re-announce servers whenever the game or ui reloads,
as well as whenever the server resets.)
(Perhaps this is less robust in some way?)
(Manual effort needed to clean out the imported packages, similar to what
is done in some gui code for rerunning scripts.)
Overall, it is probably reasonably easy for developers to just shut down
this host server and restart it, if they want to update their server code;
x4 side should automatically reconnect.
