class Pipe:
    '''
    Base class for Pipe_Server and Pipe_Client.
    Aims to implement any shared functionality.

    TODO: switch to paired unidirectional pipes instead of a single
    bidirectional pipe, to better match what linux would need, and
    to enable servers to set parallel read/write threads without them
    blocking each other by trying to use the same pipe (eg. pipe
    waiting to be Read will obstruct to other thread trying to Write)
    
    Parameters:
    * pipe_name
      - String, name of the pipe without OS path prefix.
    * buffer_size
      - Int, bytes to reserve for the buffers in each direction.
      - This has to be larger than the largest message that will pass
        through the pipe, and large enough that writes from x4 to the
        server will never fill the pipe to capacity.
      - Defaults to 64 kB.
      - Pipe_Clients use this for knowing how much to read.

    Attributes:
    * pipe_file
      - Open pipe/file object.
    * pipe_path
      - String, path with name for the pipe.
      - Must be: "//<server>/pipe/<pipename>"
    * nowait_set
      - Bool, if True then the pipe is in non-blocking mode, and doesn't
        wait for read/write to go through.
      - Defaults to not-set (blocks).
