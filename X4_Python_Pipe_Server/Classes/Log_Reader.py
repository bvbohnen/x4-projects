class Log_Reader:
    '''
    Class object for reading game output log files.
    This will advance to the end of the log when opened, and will increment
    through new log lines.

    Paramters:
    * log_path
      - Path, path to the log file to be read.

    Attributes:
    * file
      - Open instance of the file.
      - This will generally be advanced to near the end of the file.
    * partial_line
      - A partially read line for the current read attempt.
    '''
    '''
    Notes on possible approaches:
    1) named pipes
        Supported on windows and linux, but windows requires specific path
        names, so is not suitable for capturing game logs.
    2) writing inputmap from game
        The lua can save an inputmap file of a given name.
        Overall clumsier than logging files.
    3) Async polling the log file in append mode
        Game appends to the log, polling picks up new lines.
        This function will retain state to know which line was last read,
        to know when a new line arrives to be returned.

    Going to try (3) for now. This requires the log file be pre-opened.
