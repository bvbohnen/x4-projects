'''
Server which will capture select keyboard key presses, and will
signal them to x4 accordingly, to be bound x4-side to MD cues.

Uses the pynput package (not included with anaconda or standard python).

'''

'''
Keyboard capture example here:
https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html

This Listener appears to inherit from Thread, to be started and run
in parallel.
When keys are pressed, it feeds a key object to a provided callback function.

"The key parameter passed to callbacks is a pynput.keyboard.Key, for special
keys, a pynput.keyboard.KeyCode for normal alphanumeric keys, or just None
for unknown keys."

That page also advises doing very little in the listener callback functions,
since long running callbacks can cause problems with new input capture.

Windows vk codes:
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes

Scancodes (Ego keys appear to match this)(only for standard english):
 https://github.com/wgois/OIS/blob/master/includes/OISKeyboard.h
 Note: in testing this appears to be bugged, with numlock/pause reversed.

Doc on windows input handling:
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/about-keyboard-input
Note: various keys, generally those on the numpad, will alias to each other.
These are distinguished by an "extended-key" flag.
" The extended keys consist of the ALT and CTRL keys on the right-hand side
of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys
in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; the NUM LOCK key; the BREAK
(CTRL+PAUSE) key; the PRINT SCRN key; and the divide (/) and ENTER keys in the
numeric keypad."

win32api.MapVirtualKey will translate a vk to a scancode, but the scancode
is always the non-extended version (eg. VK_HOME maps to the numpad7 scancode).

By observation, it appears the x4 scancodes that deal with extended
keys will use the non-extended scancode by default, and then set bit 8
for the extended flag.  Eg. VK_LCONTROL is 0x1D, VK_RCONTROL is 0x9D.
