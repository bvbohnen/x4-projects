<!-- @doc-title MD Pipe Connection Helper -->
  
<!--
Library of functions to aid in writing MD interfaces to external servers.

Currently just supports passively reading a pipe.
    
Notes on server access looping cues:

  The cues for accessing the server, either pinging or reading, form
  oscillating loops.  A ping that fails in the callback will re-ping,
  and a read that succeeds or times out will re-read (for the next message).
  Stopping oscillating loops upon reset (game or ui reload) is non-trivial
  to do in a robust, bug-resistant way.
  
  If the cues are made static, they require reset_cue to reuse.  However, this
  command appears to only take effect at the end of a game frame, and hence
  all attempts to re-call a cue that was reset earlier in the same frame
  will fail.  Same-frame recall is a common case, so all experiments with
  resetting static cues were dead ends.
  
  If the cues are instantiated, they can be recalled in the same frame, but
  there is a danger of multiple instances being active, which is not
  wanted.  While the general design of this api would try to avoid such
  multi-instance problems, bugs are always possible.
  
  The current design packs all oscillating cues in a parent Server_Access_Loop
  cue.  When signalled, this cue will record its instance into a global
  variable, and a condition will prevent a new instance starting if the
  prior one is still active.  Internally, a conditionless cue is used to
  start the pinging loop.  When the api reloads (such as on a pipe disconnect
  event), an internal cue will cancel the instance of Server_Access_Loop,
  such that a new instance can be started.

  <!--@doc-cue
    Library package of cues used to simplify handling server connections
    by supporting the following behaviors:
    * Ping server until succesfully connecting,
    * Listen for server messages,
    * Detect disconnections and recover.
    
    Note: the parameters of this library will all be references to other
    libraries containing action blocks to execute here.  Such action blocks
    will use the namespace of the Server_Reader instance, and their
    scope for md cue lookups will be from the Pipe_Server_Lib file.
        
    Parameters:
    * Actions_On_Reload
      - Library of actions to perform when reloading after a pipe
        disconnect, savegame reload, ui reload, as well as initial creation.
      - Should set attributes: Pipe_Name, and optionally DebugChance.
      - May add other variables to the library instance, if desired.
    * Actions_On_Connect
      - Optional library of actions to perform upon connecting to the server.
      - May signal $Start_Reading to begin passive reading of the pipe.
    * Actions_On_Read
      - Optional library of actions to perform when reading a message from 
        the server.
      - The message will be in event.param.
      
    Attributes (write these in Actions_On_Reload):
    * $Pipe_Name
      - Name of the pipe used to communicate with the python host.
    * $DebugChance
      - Optional, 0 or 100.
      
    Interface variables:
    * $Start_Reading
      - Internal cue, made available as a variable.
      - Must be signalled to start the server connection routine.
      - If the connection is ever broken, which will occur on a Reload
        or possibly through param actions, this needs to be signalled
        again to reconnect.
      - Note: this is only available 2 frames after the Server_Reader
        cue is set up (as opposed to 1 frame delay for other attributes).
  
    Local variables:
    * $server_access_loop_cue
      - Cue or null, the currently active Server_Access_Loop cue instance.
      - Starts as null. If an active instance dies, the "exists" property
        will return false.
    * $server_connected
      - Flag, 1 when the server has been pinged succesfully and appears to
        have a valid connection. 0 before connection is set up, or after
        an error/disconnect. Used to suppress some writes before a
        connection is made, though shouldn't be critical to functionality.
    * $ping_count
      - Int, how many failed pings have occurred.
      - Used to increase ping delay after failures.
      - Not an exactly count; only goes up to the highest delay, eg. 10.
        
    Note: 
      x4 has problems when a cue using this library is created alongside
      the action-libraries to be given as parameters.  While other cues can
      be passed in this way, libraries cannot.      
      As a workaround, a dummy cue can be wrapped around the cue
      that refs this library.

              On timeout, loops to another read.
              Currently not expecting control messages, but they may be added
              in the future.
              
              Note: this will be at least 1 frame after Read_Message.
              
              Note: the lua api will raise a disconnect signal if it sees the
              host server disconnect, which triggers Reloaded and hence cancels
              this Server_Access_Loop.  On a game reload, the lua is reset and
              cannot send this signal, but Reloaded triggers anyway in this
              case, again killing this cue.
              As such, this cue doesn't need to handle errors,
              but will be set up to do so for redundancy in case of bugs.
