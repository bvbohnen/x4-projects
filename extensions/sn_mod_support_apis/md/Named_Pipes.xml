<!-- @doc-title MD Named Pipe API -->
  
<!-- @doc-overview
MD API support for working with named pipes for inter-process communication.
An external server (eg. written in Python) will create an OS named pipe,
and this api will connect to it as a client.
This will tie into related functions in an accompanying lua script.

Note: lua module supports only Windows named pipes.

Goals:
 - Allow user to access one or more named pipes, with arbitrary names.
 - Handle pipe write and read requests, in a non-blocking manner.
 - Recover safely on game save/reload, server shutdown/restart, ui reload, etc.
  
Operation notes:
 - The actual OS level pipe connections are handled in lua.
 - Minimal global state is tracked here; each access cue is self-sufficient.
 - Read/Write requests kick off cue instances that schedule the operation
   with the lua code, and then listen for a lua callback, ui reload (which
   wipes lua state), or timeout.
 - At least 1 frame of delay occurs on returning an operation result from
   lua back to md.
 - A user-supplied callback cue is called when access completes.
 - Any access error returns a special message to the callback cue.
 - Any pipe error will trigger an error on all pending accesses.
 - Such pipe errors will occur on game reloading, ui reload, server shutdown.
    
Usage:
 - See Read and Write cues below for how to call them.
 - User code should expect errors to occur often, and handle as needed.
 - Exact message protocol and transaction behavior depends on the external
   server handling a specific pipe.
 - If the OS pipe gets broken, the server should shutdown and remake
   the pipe, as the lua client cannot reconnect to the old pipe
   (in testing so far).
 - If passing rapid messages, recommend finding a way to join them together
   into one, or else have multiple read requests in flight at once, to
   avoid throttling due to the 1 frame lua->md delay.
    
Note on timeouts:
 - If an access times out in the MD, it will still be queued for service
   in the lua until the pipe is closed.
 - This is intentional, so that if the server is behaving correctly but
   tardy, writes and reads will still get serviced in the correct
   order.

<!--
TODO:
 - Test through multiple save/reloads.
 - Add Transact function (convenient write+read, lower overhead).
 - Maybe rename lua call signals to prefix with Named_Pipes.

    Attributes:          
    * access_counter
      - Int, number of accesses performed, with some rollover.

        completion signals to match them to the right callback cue.
        
    * reserved_ids
      - Table of reserved access ids. Values are dummy 1s.
      - Continuous reads will reserve their id to avoid conflict after
        rollover.
                
    * $pipe_name_prefix
      - String, prefix to add to all pipe names to construct the OS path.
      - On windows, this is "\\.\pipe\"
      - Not used; prefix attached in lua to simplify some signalling.
      
    * $pipe_status_cues
      - List of registered top level cues handling specific pipes.
      - Used for menu display.
      - Filled by calls to Register_Menu_Entry when Reloaded is signalled.

    User function to read a pipe. Note: the lua-to-md frame delay means
    that read responses will always be delayed by at least one frame.
    
    Param: Table with the following items:
    * pipe
      - Name of the pipe being written, without OS path prefix.
    * cue
      - Callback, optional, the cue to call when the read completes.
    * continuous
      - Bool, optional, if True then this read will continuously run,
        returning messages read but not ending the request.
      - This allows a pipe to be read multiple times in a single frame
        with a single read request (otherwise multiple parallel read
        requests would be needed).
      - Should not be used with timeout.
    * time
      - Timeout, optional, the time until a pending read is cancelled.
      - After a timeout, the pipe will still listen for the message and
        throw it away when it arrives. This behavior can be changed with
        the next arg.
    * cancel_on_timeout
      - Bool, if a timeout event should also cancel all pending
        reads to the pipe (triggers errors for requests other than
        this one).
      - Defaults false.
      
    Returns:
    - Whatever is read from the pipe in event.param to the callback cue.
    - If the read fails on bad pipe, returns 'ERROR'.
    - If the read times out, returns 'TIMEOUT'.
    - If the read is cancelled on game or ui reload, returns 'CANCELLED'.

        - Optional for writes.
      * $time
        - Time, how long to allow for access before cancelling it.
        - A timeout will trigger a 'TIMEOUT' return value to the callback cue.
        - Optional.
        - Defaults to 1000000s (~270 hours), to basically be disabled.
