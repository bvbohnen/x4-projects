Pipe state objects, generally alive while the link is set up.
Keys are the pipe names sent from the MD side, without path extension.
    
Each entry is a subtable with these fields:
* name
  - Name of the pipe (same as the key).
* file
  - File object to read/write/close.
* retry_allowed
  - Bool, if a failed access is allowed one retry.
  - Set prior to an access attempt if the pipe was already open, but
    is not known to be still connected.
  - On a retry attempt, this flag should be cleared.
* suppress_reads_when_paused
  - Bool, if true then messages read during a game pause are thrown away.
* read_fifo
  - FIFO of lists of [callback IDs or function handles, continuous_read]
    for read completions.
  - Callback ID is a string.
  - Function handle is for any lua function, taking 1 argument.
  - continuous_read is a bool, if true then the current read request at the
    top of the fifo will not be removed by normal read messages.
  - Entries removed as reads complete.
  - When empty, stop trying to read this pipe.
* write_fifo
  - FIFO of lists of [callback ID, message pending writing]
  - Entries removed as writes complete succesfully or fail completely.
  - When empty, stop trying to write this pipe.

-- Garbage collection functions for pipe files.
--[[
    Without this, if the ui is reloaded and a pipe client file handle lost,
    the server still sees it as connected.
    Hopefully by setting close() to be called at garbage collection, this
    problem can be avoided.
    
    Lua notes: objects have metatables of implicit functions that get
    called on them. To control garbage collection, a new metatable needs
    to be set on the File with a __gc member that is the function to call.
    But this is only 5.2 onward, and x4 is 5.1.
    
    Apparently lua 5.1 is even more of a mess about this.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27426704/lua-5-1-workaround-for-gc-metamethod-for-tables
    Copy this function below, use it on the pipe table, and hope.
        
    Success: with this the python server now sees the pipe properly
    closed on ui or game reload, though potentially with some delay
    that can be potentially fixed by forcing collectgarbage on
    a ui reload.
