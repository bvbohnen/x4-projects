General behavior will be to roughly match X3:
- Each press increases zoom stepping (up from 1x), on some granularity.
- Holding key maintains zoom (local timeout gets reset on key repeat).
- Releasing key, or no hold events until timeout (safety), releases zoom.
- Two zoom states: zoom wanted, and zoom current.
- Some transition speed between current and wanted, so zoom is smoother.

TODO: develop this out with smooth transitions.
version 1 will just be fixed instant steppings.

TODO: doesnt always reset fully, why?
- It looks like the recalibration problem isn't just on switching ships,
but often happens when switching fovs. Just one fov step down and back
up seems to normally work, but multiple steps screw up. Not consistently,
though.
Observations: 
- [zoom -> back] recovers okay
- [zoom -> zoom -> back] only goes to some intermediate point between 
  original and first zoom. Eg. if started at 100 degrees, may end up at 90,
  even though this doesn't match any of the intermediate steps.
- [zoom - zoom - back] could also end up with a wider fov then started,
  if it was already really narrow to begin with. Eg. 40°-20°-10°-90°.
- Float/int doesn't seem to matter; game has already drifted to the baseline
  being a <1 float during these tests.
- Switching first zoom point to 1.5x, [zoom -> back] no longer restores,
  but drifts in, eg. 100°->67°->90°.

Could there be some sort of background rollover occurring?
- 2x-4x-8x test below had zoom-in drift, but never went back
  to a wider zoom in the amount of tests done (maybe not enough).
- However, the larger zooms (eg. 10x) with big jumps do have some sort
  of rollover occurring.
- So yes, probably.

Is there a snapback mechanic, where one fov step-and-back is okay, but
going two fov steps in a row triggers recalibration somehow?
- No; trying different multipliers recreates issue with one step.

Are powers-of-2 stable, but unstable otherwise?
- Not entirely.  2x and 4x zoom recovered, 8x did not.
- However, though 8x had zoom drift, it never went back to wide fov,
  just kept zooming more and more.

Could truncation be occurring?
- Seems plausible.  10x zoom snap back would sometimes go to wider fov,
  but 8x zoome snap back always goes to narrower fov.

Is it a float/int issue, where part of the code supports floats, part doesnt?
- Possible; hard to say. Graphics should be working in radians/floats, but
  could have some fixed point and precision loss occurring.

Tests on specific zoom levels:
1.5 : drift in
2   : stable
3   : drift out
4   : stable
5   : drift in
6   : drift in
7   : drift in
8   : drift in (large)
9   : drift out (large)
10  : drift out (large)

For now, limit to 2x and 4x and see how it does.

Note: if a user exits the game while zoomed (eg. set the hotkey to alt and
used alt-f4), the user config.xml saves the zoomed fov value, and repeatedly
doing this eventually sets the saved fov to 0.0. After this point, using
the zoom hotkey will make the whole screen go black.
TODO: think of a workaround for this (eg. detect game quitting somehow and
restore fov).
